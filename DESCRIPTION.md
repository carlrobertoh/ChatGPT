<!-- Plugin description -->

CodeGPT is an AI-powered code assistant designed to help you with various programming activities. It is a great alternative to GitHub Copilot, AI Assistant, Codiumate, or any other extension on the JetBrains marketplace.

We equip you with the latest models, advanced tools, and on-premise solutions that are designed to significantly enhance your developer experience.

Access top-tier language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Mistral, and others, or opt for a self-hosted model for a full offline experience.

## From cloud providers to custom setups

Access market-leading LLMs with your own key, or use a privately hosted model within your corporate network.

- **Bring your own key:** Connect the plugin with your preferred provider using your own API key. Use our [hosted service](https://codegpt.ee/#pricing) for a full experience.

- **Customize your own setup:** Connect the plugin with privately hosted models. Use our OpenAI API-compatible provider configuration for end-to-end integration.
