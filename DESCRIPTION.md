> Completions are currently supported only for OpenAI GPT-3.5 and locally hosted models.

### Chat (with Vision)

Get instant coding advice through a ChatGPT-like interface. Ask questions, seek explanations, or get guidance on your projects without leaving your IDE.

CodeGPT also supports vision models and image understanding, allowing you to attach images for more context-aware assistance. It can detect new screenshots automatically, saving you time by eliminating the need to manually upload images each time you take a screenshot.
